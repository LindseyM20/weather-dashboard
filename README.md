## Description:

Here you will find files for a web application that allows the user to look up the current weather and 5-day forecast in any city. 

Dynamically updated CSS and Bootstrap lend a clean display of weather details. Utilizing local storage, the JavaScript and JQuery assure that the up-to-date weather of the user's most recently searched city displays when the page is refreshed or reopened. The date is kept current using the Moment.js library, and real-time weather data is retrieved using AJAX calls to the Open Weather Map API.


## Installation:

N/A


## Usage Instructions:

To use this program, use your browser to go to https://lindseym20.github.io/weather-dashboard/.

Type a city in the text field, or choose a city from the list once you have searched cities.
